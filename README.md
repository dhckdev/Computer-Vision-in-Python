# 👁️ Computer Vision in Python

Hey there! 👋  
I'm a student who recently dove into the fascinating world of **Computer Vision (CV)** — where code meets sight, and algorithms start to *see* the world 🌍👓  

This repository is my little lab 🧪 where I experiment, build, and learn step-by-step.  
From basic image processing to object detection and maybe even some AI magic 🤖✨ — this is where I document my learning journey.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Exploring
- 🖼️ Image Processing with **OpenCV** and **NumPy**  
- 🔍 Object Detection & Feature Extraction  
- 🎨 Image Transformations and Filters  
- 🧩 Understanding how machines interpret visual data  

---

## 🚀 Goals
I'm not building production-ready apps (yet 😅),  
but rather learning the fundamentals by coding small, focused projects — each one helping me *see* a bit more clearly into the world of CV.  

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- (and a lot of curiosity 🔥)
